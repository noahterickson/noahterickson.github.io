<p>SPOILER ALERT</p>
<p>This post potentially contains spoilers for the following books:</p>
<ul class="last simple">
<li><em>The Three Body Problem</em></li>
<li><em>Pet Semetary</em></li>
<li><em>Dark Matter</em></li>
<li><em>House of Leaves</em></li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Since the beginning of 2019 I have made a concious effort to increase the amount of time I spend reading. Prior to this effort I may have completed a few books a year but have
finished four in 2019 so far. I wish I would've documented my thoughts about two books I've read this year in particular: <em>Three Body Problem</em> and <em>House of Leaves</em>. Before I get started
on a new book blogging adventure I will reflect on these books retroactively in this post.</p>
<p>I started <em>The Three Body Problem</em> by Liu Cixin in early January and thought it quite entertaining. As a fan of space opera I felt right at home with the idea of the Trisolarian's interstellar
roadtrip to Earth in the hopes of conquering the planet.</p>
<p>My wife and I both read Stephen King's <em>Pet Semetary</em> in anticipation of the movie re-adapation that came out last week. I don't want to talk about the movie in this post but I will say it
was not good though. After completing the book I looked for other peoples reviews of the book to get additional perspective. The thing that stood out the most to me is the people who said
this book is more terifying if you have children. I will most likely revisit this book down
the road.</p>
<p>I came across a recommendation for <em>Dark Matter</em> after reading <em>The Three Body Problem</em>. It took me a while to realize that I had picked up the wrong <em>Dark Matter</em> and ended up reading Michelle Paver's
book of the same name instead of Blake Crouch's. I stuck with <em>Dark Matter</em> because it was a quick read and the suspense kept me interested. The protaganist however, Jack Miller, was quite obnoxious and
I was more worried for his group of huskies than I was for him.</p>
<p>After reading <em>Pet Semetary</em> I wanted to get more into suspense/horror stories and came across <em>House of Leaves</em> by Mark Z. Danielewski in a couple reddit book recommendation threads.
I really enjoyed <em>House of Leaves</em> but don't even know where to start this summary. The structure of the book was a bit confusing at first but once I got the hang of what was going on I found the most enjoyment
in the story of the Navidson's. Will and Karen were the characters I cared most about in this story.</p>

<p>As I stated in my "Hello World" post this blog is mainly intended to be my personal book journal. Despite the blogs purpose, I didn't want to limit it's scope unecessarily and thought
I should give it a broader name than just "Book Blog" which is what I had started calling it. During a brief period of cleverness (while doing something completely unrelated) I came
up with the name "Bug, Duck, Goose", a play on the children's game "Duck, Duck, Goose."</p>
<p>Now please sit tight and allow me to explain the cleverness behind the name by talking first about bugs. My dayjob consists
of developing a a little bit  of software to aid the development of even more firmware. For whatever reason, bugs are pretty much inevitable in any of the projects that I have been
exposed to in my education and career. It's a natural part of software development and the reason that debugging and testing practices are necessary.</p>
<p>Ducks are an invaluable way to debug issues in code. The idea here, which is not my own (the origins of rubber duck debugging could be found by a quick Google search), is that if a person who is developing a piece
of software runs into a bug they may figure out how to fix the bug if they can explain the problem to a rubber duck. The rubber duck here isn't important, it could be any animal
or coworker for that matter. This method is so effective that I have a rubber duck (with sunglasses) on my desk at work that sits even closer to me than my nearest coworker. I also try
my best to provide rubber ducks to anyone in need of one at my work.</p>
<p>Geese are a common sighting at my companies' campus which has a small pond and quite a bit of grass. Every spring we get large flocks of both Canadian and Cackling geese. Putting goose
in the blogs' name seemed natural since I often swivel around in my chair while debugging an issue and watch the geese graze their way across our fields of grass. As a semi-related
anecdote my team at work has spotted a tracked goose twice in the past couple of years and submitted the collared goose's name to the USGS. The gooses' name will be omitted from this blog
for privacy reasons but he has become somewhat of a mascot to our team.</p>
<p>I hope this posting gives a bit more insight into the blogs name which may seem a bit silly at first. I also hope you find it clever and don't think I'm just a quack.</p>
<p>In addition, keeping with the unecessarily restrictive book-related scope of this blog, the name of this post is inspired by Part 4, Chapter 7 of <em>How to Win Friends &amp; Influence People</em> by Dale Carnegie.
Our dog's name is Bruce and he is a good boy.</p>

<p>This blog will mainly serve as my personal journal for books I've read and is intended to be nothing more than a collection of my thoughts. Despite being a blog for my own personal use I realize this is public and accessible by anyone who stumbles upon it so I will provide a quick introduction.</p>
<p>I'm an electrical engineer living in Portland focused on embedded firmware development. I spend most of my workday behind a keyboard developing software yet I do not have a knack for writing. I find a lot of enjoyment in my work and my favorite work days are the ones where I sit at my desk developing Python test scripts, bringing up a new micro-controller or optimizing some older code.</p>
<p>My free time is spent with my wife hanging out around the house. Various house projects and gardening keep us busy enough but we also spend our fair share watching movies together, playing video games and reading.</p>
<p>Recently I have found a handful of books on our bookshelf with cracked spines but I do not recall their contents. This discovery prompted me to start this blog. I enjoy reading science fiction (Warhammer 40K space operas) but actively try to read more classic books as well.</p>
<p>I'm starting this blog off with a typical hello world post. My intention is to write a post per chapter I complete but I am unsure if I have the diligence to keep up with this schedule.</p>
