    <p>Holy smokes I completely forgot that I blew right through The Cyclist's Training Bible on a road trip to visit my wife's aunt and uncle in Idaho. I mean, I really went all out with this thing. I bought a trainer, a power meter and put together an annual training plan. Funny enough my season was supposed to start yesterday but I have postponed it another week since I am still recovering from my crash. I'm really looking forward to getting started though and seeing an improvement in my fitness!</p>

<p>While I've been recovering from my aforementioned bicycle wreck I have been reading quite a bit more. I jumped back into the Warhammer 40K Eisenhorn trilogy by Dan Abnet and finished Malleus pretty quickly. It was a fun read and I really appreciate how well Dan Abnet can put the reader in this crazy galaxy. I would say universe but galaxy seems more fiting since the Warhammer 40K "universe" is mainly contained in one. My favorite thing about reading a Warhammer 40K book is that the author is able to focus more on the narrative than world building since there have been so many books establishing the lore.</p>
<p>For every Warhammer 40K book with a bent spine on my bookshelf there are five other books I feel I should read. I tend to spend half my time either enjoying the book I'm currently reading or wishing I was reading something a bit more constructive that had a bit more "merit". I don't have a formal definition of merit here but what I'm getting at is that Malleus sure isn't a Harvard Classic. Sometimes I feel so focused on efficiency and what I ought to be doing that I find it hard to realize that time enjoyed reading is time well spent.</p>

<p>I read The Martian in mid September. Despite seeing the movie in theatres I still enjoyed the book. I found that I had forgotten most of the plot and the book provided some better technical explanations than the movie was able to. Andy Weir's style fit my interests and I will likely pick up his book Artemis at some point.</p>
<p>Cycling has completely consumed my life by the way. In mid-October I went for my most difficult ride yet. Round trip was about 70 miles with 6,100 feet of elevation gain. I'm looking forward to besting this ride soon as my endurance increases. Shortly after this ride I had my first wreck and am just about recovered. The wreck left me with a minor abrasion on my upper lip and chin so I have abstained from shaving for the past couple weeks. Aero is life but I may need to keep this beard for a while.</p>

<p>It's been a while since I have created an entry here. My excuse is that work got busy and I have been treating the sun as cycling weather more than reading weather. I haven't talked at all about cycling on here but I picked up my old bike to commute with in late April and commuted by bike nearly the entire month of May. In mid-may I bought myself a Trek Checkpoint AL3 for a new commuter bike but have also been taking it on longer weekend rides. Perhaps when I get a bit faster I will embed a Strava ride in a blog post.</p>
<p>Anyways, my wife and I just returned from a week-long family camping trip and we were able to read a lot. I was going to start "Blood of Elves" from The Witcher series in order to read up before the Netflix show comes out but my cousin Robby was kind enough to explain the reading order of the books to me. Turns out this book should be read after two short story collections. I will be getting "The Last Wish" soon in order to start this series. Luckily, I brought a second book, Dark Matter by Blake Crouch. This time it is the correct book titled Dark Matter that was recommended to me earlier this year.</p>

<p>My wife and I just got back from a week vacation in Hawaii. The flight was about five and a half hours and I was able to finish the rest of Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance on the flight.</p>
<p>During our time in Hawaii I also started and finished The Fellowship of the Ring. I will not provide blog entries for this book other than saying I enjoyed it!</p>

<p>Well, I haven't exactly been keeping up on my reading, nor this blog. I've been enjoying the Spring weather and accomplishing some long put off yard work recently. I have also come into possession of my old 1980's Puegeot bicycle and have started commuting with it. In fact, I've been commuting so much that I purchased a new bicycle that I can commute with and take on longer weekend rides. The Puegeot wasn't exactly in the best shape after all this time and I went on a test ride of a couple Trek's and coulnd't leave without one. Kinda funny that the Peugeot taught me a little about motorcycle maintenace, err, bicycle mainteance rather. Anyways, I blasted through chapters 10-17 a couple nights ago to finish this book before an upcoming trip and have roughly half left to go. I thought I would reflect on the contents of these chapters since they resonated with me.</p>
<p>During chapters 10-17 the narrator and his group of riding companions reach their destination in Bozeman, Montana where the narrator (Phaedrus) used to be a profressor. He meets up with a couple old friends and they chat, eat and drink. The narrator touches on some points in these conversations about quality and how to teach people to "inject" quality into whatever it is they do. This conversation about quality really connected with me because I have mentored a few engineering students in the past and have found myself faced with issues similar to the narrators. The one thing that really stood out to me was the narrator convincing a girl to write an essay who couldn't come up with content for it. So he narrowed down the topic and she still couldn't think of anything. Finally, the narrator suggested an even narrower topic, that the girl write about a building that she passes everyday. Soon enough the girl turned in a longer than necessary essay all about this building. My takeaway from this is the girl really took that topic to heart for whatever reason but made the essay hers and really made it quite good.</p>
<p>I remember when I was an intern at my current employer in 2015 and had this realization that the project my mentor had given me was my project. Not my mentors, not the teams but mine and only mine. Sure, I could ask for advice from my mentor since they could see pitfalls of my design or anticipate problems I may face but I really felt that I had to take ownership of this project. I finished the first revision of my project before I ever asked any questions about it thinkingt it would be better to ask for criticism/improvements of my design rather than asking how to design it. After my internship my employer hired me and I have been on the other side of this where I have had interns asking me for how to design something rather than criticism/improvements. I'm sure that as I mentor future students I will get better at giving advice, not only how to design, but how to be an engineer. If I can get my interns to realize that they are the experts on their project and I will be looking to them for answers I think I will have succeeded.</p>
