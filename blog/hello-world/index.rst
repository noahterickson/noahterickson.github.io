This blog will mainly serve as my personal journal for books I've read and is intended to be nothing more than a collection of my thoughts. Despite being a blog for my own personal use I realize this is public and accessible by anyone who stumbles upon it so I will provide a quick introduction.

I'm an electrical engineer living in Portland focused on embedded firmware development. I spend most of my workday behind a keyboard developing software yet I do not have a knack for writing. I find a lot of enjoyment in my work and my favorite work days are the ones where I sit at my desk developing Python test scripts, bringing up a new micro-controller or optimizing some older code.

My free time is spent with my wife hanging out around the house. Various house projects and gardening keep us busy enough but we also spend our fair share watching movies together, playing video games and reading.

Recently I have found a handful of books on our bookshelf with cracked spines but I do not recall their contents. This discovery prompted me to start this blog. I enjoy reading science fiction (Warhammer 40K space operas) but actively try to read more classic books as well.

I'm starting this blog off with a typical hello world post. My intention is to write a post per chapter I complete but I am unsure if I have the diligence to keep up with this schedule.
